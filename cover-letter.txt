Dear CACM editors,

We hereby submit the attached short manuscript for consideration as a CACM
Viewpoints article.

The four authors have been deeply involved in developing strategies for
addressing the carbon footprint of conferences within SIGPLAN; the goal of
the article is to begin the process of broadening what we feel is a crucial
conversation to include voices from across ACM.  We've tried to be as
succinct as possible while still conveying the core argument that this is an
issue _for ACM_ and its members, along with a little taste of some potential
strategies for addressing it.

We have spoken to Andrew about our intention to submit such an article.  

Best,

    - Benjamin (and Mike, Crista, and Jens)
