Paras 1-3.5 as now.

Theme of paper: Public accounting for CO2e spent, and eventually: Putting a price on it, to create downward pressure. Could be ACM imposing the price, or society at large

Accounting for CO2 spent
- Analogy with calories displayed on menus
- Data gathering now the responsibility of conference organizers 
- Nudge toward dropping frivolous spending of CO2. A little bit about 
  optimizing choices here
  - What might they do? On-line PC meetings. Offsets. These are easy.
    - CO2 offsets on registration pages, so that subtracted from their accounting
  - But, what about CO2-friendly locations? Not so easy. Show our data. 

Putting a price on CO2
- Analogy: Charging more for higher calorie meals -- not there yet!
- Ultimately we will have to do this when "easy" CO2 reductions aren't possible anymore -- organizers will really need to compare apples to oranges.
- So: pricing. If ACM does it -- what will it do with the money?
  - CO2 offsets, at first
  - Good works of other sorts (OA?)
- If society does it -- natural consequences. We ultimately hope to get here
