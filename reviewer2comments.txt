Recommendation: Accept

Comments:
This paper is much improved from the previous version, and I applaud the authors for their thoughtful re-working in response to the reviews. I think this version is nicely provocative, and should generate some much needed discussion within the ACM community.

The two recommendations proposed in the paper, carbon accounting and carbon pricing, are sensible and solid steps the ACM community could take. Implementing them will not be easy, and there will be a lot of details to be worked out. Some of these will be very tricky. 

Carbon accounting is notoriously tricky, as it requires many decisions on how to standardize what gets counted and how. And the comparisons have to be done very carefully (see for example https://doi.org/10.1021/es900213p <https://doi.org/10.1021/es900213p> <https://doi.org/10.1021/es900213p <https://doi.org/10.1021/es900213p>> on the challenge of doing this for cities). However, if ACM chooses to develop and promote its own model, that may circumvent many of the problems that occur in multi-jurisdictional settings, and could potentially offer a model that other scientific societies can adopt. I think the paper should also acknowledge the reputational risk to ACM in taking this step - the numbers are likely to be high, and hence may be used to criticize both the ACM and the broader academic community for our carbon-intensive behaviours. Despite the difficulties and the risk, I strongly agree with the recommendation, and I agree that routine reporting of the carbon footprint of ACM conferences is a necessary step forward.

Carbon pricing is in some ways even trickier. The core problem is how to determine a price that reflects the true social cost of carbon, without immediately paralyzing the community. A steady and predictable annual ramp on the price, as recommended in the paper is a necessary component. But setting both the initial price and the ramp are difficult political decisions, and experience around the world shows they are nearly always set too low to be effective ? indeed, more recent estimates put the global cost of carbon at nearly an order of magnitude higher than the highest existing carbon pricing policies (e.g. a median value of US$417 estimated in https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-018-0282-y <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-018-0282-y> <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-018-0282-y <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-018-0282-y>>). An additional difficulty for the ACM will be how to account for interactions with existing carbon pricing schemes that apply to some jurisdictions but not others - e.g. researchers in countries with a strong existing carbon pricing might protest that they?re paying twice. I don?t think these issues make the proposal unworkable, but they will have to be handled carefully in developing a workable pricing scheme for ACM?s conferences.

This leads me to address what I think is the most important omission in the paper. To guide the development of a pricing scheme, and to mitigate potential criticism of its large carbon footprint, the ACM should also commit itself to a series of specific emissions reduction goals over time. Without such targets, there will be no way of reviewing and adjusting the carbon pricing mechanism, nor even of assessing its success. I would suggest a suitable goal, in line with the latest evidence from climate science, is to follow the Carbon Law proposed in the recent paper by Rockstrom et al (https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aah3443 <https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aah3443> <https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aah3443 <https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aah3443>>), namely to halve emissions every decade from now on. I should note that the term ?Carbon Law? was inspired by Moore?s Law, so it?s fitting that the ACM should adopt this as its core goal. I think adding this as a third recommendation would greatly strengthen the paper, and give the existing recommendations more teeth.

Other than these comments, I strongly recommend expedited publication of this paper, to kick start the much-needed discussion of these issues within the community.
